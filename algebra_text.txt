204 ANS:

                                           The graphs of the production costs intersect at x = 3. The company should
use Site A, because the cost of Site A is lower at x = 2.

206 ANS:

x2 + 46 = 60 + 5x John and Sarah will have the same amount of money saved at 7 weeks. I set the

x2 - 5x - 14 = 0

(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0

             x=7
expressions representing their savings equal to each other and solved for the positive value of x by factoring.
